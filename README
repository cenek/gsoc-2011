LushGA is a machine learning toolkit that implements multiple variants
of the genetic algorithm (GA). This includes evolution (standard
evolution), non-spatial co-evolution, spatial evolution and spatial
co-evolution.  The implementation supports user-defined fitness
functions, the performance measurement tools to study evolutionary
dynamics, and highly configurable evolutionary search
parameters. Intended use of this toolkit is for educational,
scientific, and engineering needs.

A list of implemented features: 
User defined GA parameters:
- choosing from one of four core algorithms
- seeding with a random seed or loading previously-saved seed
- binary chromosome encoding with configurable length between 1 to
  1000 bits long
- reproduction operators include 0pt (mutation only) and 1pt
  crossover, and a bitwise mutation with user-defined probability
- fitness assessment by population sampling and local neighborhood for
  a spatially extended population
- selection for reproduction by random selection, biased roulette
  wheel and tournament selection
- offspring generation including elitism and parent replacement.

Analysis Tools for Evolutionary Dynamics:
Plots:
- fitness of best candidate solution vs generation
- coevolution plots displaying candidate solution (host) fitness and
  test case (parasite) fitness vs generation

Logs:
- experimental setup, random seed
- candidate solutions: genomes, fitness
- test cases: genomes, fitness

Proposed direction and things to do:
- Implement resource sharing for fitness assessment.
- Currently spatial coevolution assignes parasite fitness according to
  how it was evaluated with respect to a host in the same spatial
  location. An alternative option is to assign a parasite fitness with
  respect to ALL evaluations it was subjected to (not just the result
  of interaction with a host in the same local). The parasite fitness
  is then normalized by the neighborhood size (9).

  fitness distribution at given generation.
